## 1. Introduction

TrackBeau is a **desktop app made for beauty salons to aid them in managing customers' profile, bookings and services.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User

traditional GUI apps.

#### 3.2.4 Command Format
The table below explains the important technical terms to help you understand how to use the commands in TrackBeau.

| Technical Term | Meaning              | 
|----------------|----------------------|
|Command Word    | The first word of the command determines the action that TrackBeau should perform.|
|Prefix          | The characters right before each parameter which distinguishes one parameter from the other.|
|Parameter       | The words right after the prefix. Each parameter is a value given to the command to perform the specified action.|

**Example**:
* `addc n/NAME p/PHONE a/ADDRESS e/EMAIL`
* Command Word: `addc`
* Prefixes: `n/`, `p/`, `a/`, `e/`
* Parameters: `NAME`, `PHONE`, `ADDRESS`, `EMAIL`

The commands in TrackBeau follows these rules:
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [e/EMAIL]` can be used as `n/John Doe e/johnd@example.com` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[sep/SERVICE_PREFERENCE]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `sep/massage`, `sep/facial sep/massage` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `listc`, `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `listc 123`, it will be interpreted as `listc`.
