### Project: TrackBeau

TrackBeau is a **desktop app made for beauty salons to aid them in managing customers' profile, bookings and services.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TrackBeau can help you manage your customers, bookings and services faster than
traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find customers, services and bookings using a keyword.
  * What it does: Allows the user to filter and view customer, services and bookings with keywords.
  * Justification: Feature is crucial for staff members to find specific customers, services and bookings to view, edit or delete their details.
