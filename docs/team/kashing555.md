### Project: TrackBeau

TrackBeau is a desktop app for beauty salons to manage customer information, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TrackBeau can get your customer profile management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
