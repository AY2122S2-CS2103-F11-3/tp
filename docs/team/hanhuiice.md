### Project: TrackBeau

TrackBeau is a **desktop app made for beauty salons to aid them in managing customers' profile, bookings and services.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TrackBeau can help you manage your customers, bookings and services faster than
traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view schedule of a selected week.
  * What it does: allows the user to view all booking organised by the day of the week.
  * Justification: This feature allows the user to view bookings in an organised manner which help better manage the new bookings and prepare manpower ahead.
  
* **New features**: Added the ability to delete multiple customer in single delete command.
  * What it does: allows the user to specify multiple customer indexes and delete those customers.
  * Justification: There might be multiple customers profiles that need to be removed and deleting them one at a time is slow. The product should provide a convenient way to batch delete.
  
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-02-18&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=hanhuiice&tabRepo=AY2122S2-CS2103-F11-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false)
